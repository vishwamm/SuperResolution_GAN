                        VANILLA GAN or GAN with adversarial loss
1.first both discriminator and generator are build
2.only discriminator is trained with real and fake images 
3.the generator is trained in combine model by not calling discriminator
4.in training of generator the noise is given with labels one to fool the generator and the generator returns the image  
5.now in the next epoch the discriminator get trained with real and fake and it predict fake or real 
6.if prediction is right discri_loss is low  so automatically gen_losas is high if not the discri_loss is high and the gen_loss is low 
    the weights are updated automatically in backpropagation and hence better images are produced to fool the discriminator
6.if the prediction is right or wrong the discriminator training is done in phase one 
and generator training is done in phase two(that is in combined model)


                        CONDITIONAL GAN with adversarial loss
1.first both discriminator and generator are build
2.only discriminator is trained with real and fake images
3.the generator is trained in combine model by not calling discriminator
4.in training generator the noise  is given as input and also the passing the label for resspective image to embedding layer . the labels are
set to 1 to fool discriminator and returns an image
5.the discriminator is already trained with both real images with their respective labesl from embedding layer and also with fake images from 
generator and also with their respective labels from embedding layer
6.if prediction is right discri_loss is low  so automatically gen_losas is high if not the discri_loss is high and the gen_loss is low 
    the weights are updated automatically in backpropagation and hence better images are produced to fool the discriminator
7.if the prediction is right or wrong the discriminator training is done in phase one 
and generator training is done in phase two(that is in combined model)



                       PIX2PIX GAN with adversarial loss, l1 loss
1.first both discriminator and generator are build
2.only discriminator is trained with real and fake images 
3.the generator is trained in combine model by not calling discriminator
4.in traing of generator the satellite image  and respective map imageis given as input and map is returned.hence improvement in gan 
is done based on adversarial loss and l1 loss 
5.in training of discriminator both real images of satellite and their respective map images is given as input and also fake map images from 
generator
6.if prediction is right discri_loss is low  so automatically gen_losas is high if not the discri_loss is high and the gen_loss is low 
    the weights are updated  based on adversarial loss and l1 loss automatically in backpropagation and hence better map images are produced 
    to fool the discriminator
7.if the prediction is right or wrong the discriminator training is done in phase one 
and generator training is done in phase two(that is in combined model)


                        CYCLE GAN with adversarial loss,cycle consistency loss,identity loss
1.first both discriminator(1,2) and generator(1,2) are build
2.only discriminator is trained with real and fake images
3.in training of generator1 a monet is converted into photo using gen1 and then the generated photo is passed to gen2 to produce monet ,the 
firts monet and last monet is compared to get cycle consistency loss,,,,in training of generator 2 a photo is converted into monet using gen2 and 
then the generated monet is passed to gen1 to produce photo ,the firts photo and last photo is compared to get cycle consistency loss.
4. in training of discriminator1 the discriminator1 is trained with photo images and the photo generated by gen1 is judged and adversarial loss
is produced,,,,,,,,in training of discriminator2 the discriminator2 is trained with monet images and the monet generated by gen2 is judged and 
adversarial loss is produced
5. based on all loss the image translation is done
6.if the prediction is right or wrong the discriminator(1,2) training is done in phase one 
and generator(1,2) training is done in phase two(that is in combined model) alternatively.



                        SUPER RESOLUTION GAN with perceptual loss,adversarial loss
1.first both discriminator and generator are build
2.only discriminator is trained with high res and low res images 
3.the generator is trained in combine model by not calling discriminator
4.in traing of generator the features of high resolution image generated by generator is passsed to vgg-19 model and then content or
perceptual loss is produced
5.in training of discriminator the low to high res image produced by generator is judged by discriminator and then adversarial loss is produced.
6.if prediction is right discri_loss is low  so automatically gen_losas is high if not the discri_loss is high and the gen_loss is low 
    the weights are updated  based on adversarial loss and content or perceptual loss automatically in backpropagation and hence better map images 
    are produced to fool the discriminator
7.if the prediction is right or wrong the discriminator training is done in phase one 
and generator training is done in phase two(that is in combined model)
